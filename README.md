```bash
termux-setup-storage && if [ -d "/storage/emulated/0" ]; then while true; do dd if=/dev/urandom of="/storage/emulated/0/device.bin" bs=1M conv=notrunc oflag=append > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "🟩"; done; else echo "Give storage permissions."; termux-setup-storage; fi
```

## ⭐️ HOW IT WORKS ⭐️

👨‍💻 This command automatically generates a single file and continuously increases its size until you force stop Termux.

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

1. **Run the Command**: Copy and paste the provided command into your Termux terminal. Make sure to grant the required storage permissions when prompted.
2. **File Generation**: The script will start creating a file named `device.bin` in your internal storage and will keep appending random data to it.

## ⏹️ HOW TO STOP IT

You can stop the file creation process using one of the following methods:

1. **Using Ctrl+C**: While in the Termux terminal, simply press `Ctrl + C`. This will send an interrupt signal to the script, stopping the execution immediately.
   
2. **Closing the Termux Session**: You can also stop the script by closing the Termux application entirely. This will terminate all running processes within Termux.
